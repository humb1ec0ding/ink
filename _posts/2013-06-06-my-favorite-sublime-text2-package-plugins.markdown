Personally I think that the best editor is definitely [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). But [Sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is another great editor. In Sublime text, a lot of features are supported by plugins.

## [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)

Several package lists that I like.


### Language

#### [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter)

SublimeLinter is a plugin that supports "lint" programs (known as "linters"). SublimeLinter highlights lines of code the linter deems to contain (potential) errors. It also supports highlighting special annotations (for example: TODO) so that they can be quickly located.

* Java - lint via `javac -Xlint`
* Python - native, moderately-complete lint

#### [SublimeJava](https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeJava)

A plugin that provides a Java code completion view inside of Sublime Text 2. It also provides import insertion/completion and goto source/javadocs.

#### [SublimeCodeIntel](https://github.com/Kronuz/SublimeCodeIntel)

Code intelligence plugin ported from Open Komodo Editor to Sublime Text 2.



### Utility

#### [Stackoverflow search plugin](https://github.com/ericmartel/Sublime-Text-2-Stackoverflow-Plugin)

A plugin to search on Stack Overflow.

#### [BracketHighlighter](https://github.com/facelessuser/BracketHighlighter)

Bracket Highlighter matches a variety of brackets such as: `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `""`, `''`, `<tag></tag>`, and even custom brackets.

#### [Terminal](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/terminal)

Shortcuts and menu entries for opening a terminal at the current file, or the current root project folder in Sublime Text 2.

#### [Alignment](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/alignment)

Dead-simple alignment of multi-line selections and multiple selections for Sublime Text 2.

### Key-binding

#### [E-Max](https://github.com/glyph/E-Max)

Emacs key binding for the Sublime test editor. Emacs key binding is the one of the big problems for using the emacs at the begining, but in later it's the very strong cons of emacs.
